## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS with custom properties and BEM
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- If possible, avoid using margin to adjust placements. Instead, use padding, flex (gap, justify-content, align-items), or grid. 
- hsl can also take in a fourth value for alpha (hsla) to manipulate opacity. 

### Continued development

- For this design, grid might have been a better solution vs. flex. I will need to get more comfortable with grid. 
- This project provided the font in assets, but I didn't know how to use it (@font-face). I will need to look into the pros and cons of using ttf files vs. importing from Google. 

### Useful resources

- [Kevin Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqFAs5d3Yl8&t=1283s&ab_channel=KevinPowell) - The way Kevin organizes his CSS codes seems very scalable and maintainable. He also uses custom attributes in his HTML codes to dynamically(?) change background colors.
